                <p>We call this drink ‘Shrek Juice’. I’m sure you can see why! It’s so simple it’s hardly a recipe,
                    but I thought I’d go ahead and post it as I get lots of questions about how to get
                    kids started on fresh juices, and I’ve found this one a great place to start!
                    This juice just tastes like orange juice – you can’t taste the spinach.</p>
